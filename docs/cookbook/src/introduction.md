# RustAPI Cookbook

Welcome to the **RustAPI Architecture Cookbook**. This documentation is designed to be the single source of truth for the project's philosophy, patterns, and practical implementation details.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a living document. As our architecture evolves, so will this cookbook.

## What is this?
This is not just API documentation. This is a collection of:
- **Keynotes**: High-level architectural decisions and "why" we made them.
- **Patterns**: The repeated structures (like `Action` and `Service`) that form the backbone of our code.
- **Recipes**: Practical, step-by-step guides for adding features, testing, and maintaining cleanliness.

## Visual Identity
This cookbook is styled with the **RustAPI Premium Dark** theme, focusing on readability, contrast, and modern "glassmorphism" aesthetics.

## Quick Start
