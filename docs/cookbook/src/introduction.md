# RustAPI Cookbook

Welcome to the **RustAPI Architecture Cookbook**. This documentation is designed to be the single source of truth for the project's philosophy, patterns, and practical implementation details.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a living document. As our architecture evolves, so will this cookbook.

## What is this?
This is not just API documentation. This is a collection of:
- **Keynotes**: High-level architectural decisions and "why" we made them.
- **Patterns**: The repeated structures (like `Action` and `Service`) that form the backbone of our code.
- **Recipes**: Practical, step-by-step guides for adding features, testing, and maintaining cleanliness.
- **Learning Paths**: Structured progressions with real-world examples.

## 🚀 New: Examples Repository

Looking for hands-on learning? Check out our **[Examples Repository](https://github.com/Tuntii/RustAPI-examples)** with 18 complete projects:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Getting Started** | hello-world, crud-api |
| **Authentication** | auth-api (JWT), rate-limit-demo |
| **Database** | sqlx-crud, event-sourcing |
| **AI/LLM** | toon-api, mcp-server |
