# Crate Deep Dives

> [!WARNING]
> This section is for those who want to understand the framework's internal organs. You don't need to know this to *use* RustAPI, but it helps if you want to *master* it.

RustAPI is a collection of focused, interoperable crates. Each crate has a specific philosophy and "Lens" through which it views the world.

- **[rustapi-core](rustapi_core.md)**: The Engine
- **[rustapi-macros](rustapi_macros.md)**: The Magic
- **[rustapi-validate](rustapi_validation.md)**: The Gatekeeper
