[Show r/rust] RustAPI – FastAPI-like ergonomics for Rust web APIs

Hey Rustaceans! I've been working on RustAPI, a web framework that brings 
FastAPI's developer experience to Rust.

Key features:
- 5-line REST APIs with auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- Facade pattern for long-term stability
- Built-in JWT, CORS, WebSocket, and rate limiting
- TOON format for 50% token savings in LLM APIs

Just released 4 new examples: GraphQL, Microservices, Rate Limiting, 
and Middleware Chain.

Check it out: https://github.com/Tuntii/RustAPI

Would love your feedback! 🦀
```

### Twitter Thread Template:
```
1/ 🚀 Ever wanted FastAPI's simplicity in Rust? 

Meet RustAPI – a web framework that lets you build REST APIs in 5 lines:

[code snippet image]

2/ Why RustAPI?

✅ Zero-config routing with auto()
✅ Auto-generated OpenAPI docs
✅ Built-in JWT, CORS, WebSocket
✅ 50% token savings for LLM APIs (TOON format)

3/ Unlike other frameworks, RustAPI uses the Facade Pattern.

Internal upgrades (hyper, tokio) don't break your code.

4/ New examples just dropped:

🔐 Middleware Chain
🌐 Microservices
🔍 GraphQL Integration
⏱️ Rate Limiting
